1)

a) 865-868MHz, 900-920MHz

b) each sensor 125kHz, 20MHz total bandwidth available

FSK => 20MHz/125kHz = 160

LoRa orthogonality => much higher

c) higher sensitivity/range, more concurrent transmissions, better reliability

d) simple MAC protocol for little synchronization

ALOHA 

e) Gr/Gt = 2dB
d = 4000m
receiver => -146dBm
f = 900MHz

friis propogation

transmitter = -46dBm

2) IPv4 vs IPv6

a) larger address space

IPv4 2^32
IPv6 2^128 => devices uniquely addressed


b) IPv6 header 40 bytes, streamlined compared to IPv4

IPv6 address compression => consecutive groups of 0s ::

c) aecb:222::10

replace double colon with appropriate number of 0s

aecb:0222:0000:0000:....:1000

3) Bluetooth

a) Bluetooth 4.2 PHY 1Mb/s

5.2 higher bitrate

advertisement packet => 47 bytes

0.376ms

b) 10mW

same packet sent over 3 advertisement channels

10mW * 0.376ms *3

c) audio => connection oriented

beacons => advertisement

d) extended advertisements


3 primary channels
channel hopping minimise inteference
