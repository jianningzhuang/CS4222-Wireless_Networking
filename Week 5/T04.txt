Q1 battery capacity of common devices

Galaxy S23 => 2900mAh
iPhone 14 Pro Max => 4323 mAh
airpods => 49.7 mAh
apple watch Ultra => 542 mAh
MacBook Pro M2 => 58.2 Wh

what people are concerned is actual battery life in terms of time

Q2 

a) which chipset more suitable for IoT applications

Chipset 1 better in low power wireless sensor network

lesser current draw per state
faster switching time between states


b) operate at low duty cycle < 0.01%, which state would you reduce current from

for each second, active for 0.0001s, idle for 0.9999s

current consumed (TX/RX) = 10mA x 0.0001 = 10^-6 A
current consumed (IDLE) = 0.1mA x 0.9999 = 10^-4

IDLE component still larer
reduce current drawn from IDLE state

Q3


a) energy to transmit 1 bit

P = VI
E = Pt
for 1 bit to transmit => 1/bps
energy = Pt = VI x 1/bps

Bluetooth => 0.09 microJ

b) always choose low Tx Energy tech for low power IoT?

No, depends on application type

if lot of data to transfer, go for lowest energy per bit (WiFi)
if idle period dominates and data transferred is low, choose ZigBee, BLE or Backscatter
if operation on small batteries or energy harvesting, choose Backscatter
if high range, choose LoRa 

c) criteria crucial in low power IoT

ability to switch states quickly
form factor e.g size of antenna
max current draw with limited battery
ability to form network

d) Bluetooth application

sufficiently high data rate => 2Mbps
short range => 10m
low battery constraints

most smart devices

e) LoRa

low data rate => 30kbps
long range => 500m
low duty cycle, in ISM band regulations

still in research phase, starting deployment

transmit small sensor data
smart industrial control
healthcare
agriculture

f) Backscatter

minimal power draw => microWatts
frequent transmission
compact form factor => card, sticker
harvest ambient energy

agriculture
RFID
