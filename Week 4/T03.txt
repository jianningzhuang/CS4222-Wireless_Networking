1. step counting on wearable devices

accelerometer 

MEMS inertial sensors

IMU(accelerometer + gyroscope) more accurately estimate number of steps taken, more sensors => more robust to false positives

Step counting involves ML/Statistics based models to make sense of sensor data

2.
i) detect metallic objects buried in soil

metallic objects cause change in physical property of soil

magnetic properties
magnetometer => strength and direction of magnetic field
EM induction sensors => EM waves

electrical conductivity
GPR


ii) detect blood oxygen level on a wearable device

pulse oximeter sp02 levels
absorption of light at different wavelengths help determine oxygen saturation level
light emitter shines red and IR light into bloodcells
photodetector measures amount of light absorbed by blood



iii) determining water level in a tank situated on top of a building

ultrasonic sensors => high freq sound waves to measure distance between sensor and water surface

optical IR/Laser => detect amount of light reflected by water surface using light source and photodetector

iv) generate a 3D mapping of historical structures


LiDAR sensor => point cloud data x, y, z

3. Molex 10mAH, 3V

P(W) = V(V) * I(A)
Wh = Ah/V
battery life = mAh capacity/mAload current 

a)

BME 280 => 2777.78 hours

ADXL => 33.33 

OPT => 101 83.33

HM01B01 => 6.67

b) how to entend battery life

for calculation, assume sensors active at all times
do not need to continously sample sensor data

reduce sampling freq

e.g image from camera every minute, temp every hour

reducing active duration can extend battery life significantly
