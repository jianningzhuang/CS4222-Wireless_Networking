Q1

time difference taudio - tradio = d/v - d/c (d/c = 0 approximately) = 0.028s

audio timestamp same from C2 and C3 => y coordinate is 5 (middle)

d = 0.028s x 300m/s = 8.4
x^2 + y^2 = 8.4^2
x = sqrt(8.4^2 - 5^2) = 6.75

Q2

angle

tangent = b/a

Q3

app tracks location using GPS
GPS consumes 400mW
accelerometer consumes 5mW
user mostly stationary when using app

energy efficient and accurate outdoor location tracker

1. use accelerometer as trigger to detect motion
2. wake GPS only if motion is detected
3. use accelerometer to estimate small changes in location and rely less on GPS (can still be accurate)


Q4

ALOHA 18% max channel utilisation
slotted ALOHA 36% max chanel utilisation
CSMA/CA higher utilisation

CSMA/CA collision avoidance => reduces collision significantly by transmitting only when channel is idle (carrier sensing)
collision detection overhead < packet retransmission overhead
