From the output of etimer-buzzer.c, note down the value of CLOCK_SECOND. 
Find out how many clock ticks corresponds to 1s in real time.

The value of CLOCK_SECOND is 128

clock_time_t t is %ld => increase in multiples of 128

38 tick 0.296 second overhead
166 ticks 1.296s
294 ticks 2.296s
422 ticks 3.296s
...

clock ticks per second is 128


From the output of rtimer-lightSensor.c. note down the value of RTIMER_SECOND. 
Find out how many clock ticks corresponds to 1s in real time.

LightSensor => every 32 ticks

The value of RTIMER_SECOND is 65536
The value of timeout_rtimer is 16384 => 0.25s 4Hz

IMU data analysis

flat on table:
Gyro X = -1.40 to -1.10 deg/s
Gyro Y = 1.30 to 1.80 deg/s
Gyro Z = -0.20 to 0.10 deg/s

AccX = 0.01 to 0.03 G
AccY = 0.01 to 0.03 G
AccZ = -0.95 to -0.90 G

up down movement: (Z)

AccX = 0.20 to 0.40 G
AccY = -0.40 to -0.20 G
AccZ = -2.00 to 1.20 G

left right movement: cable to right (X)

AccX = -1.50 to 1.50 G
AccY = -0.40 to -0.20 G
AccZ = -0.90 to -0.50 G

forward back movement: (Y)

AccX = 0.20 to 0.40 G
AccY = -1.50 to 1.50 G
AccZ = -0.90 to -0.50 G

To make own app:
1. create new directory in /examples
2. copy Makefile and change CONTIKI_PROJECT = etimer-buzzer rtimer-lightSensor rtimer-IMUSensor
3. create .c file
4. compile

sudo make TARGET=cc26x0-cc13x0 BOARD=sensortag/cc2650 PORT=/dev/ttyACM0 <c file name without .c>

Binary Image is <c file name>.cc26x0-cc13x0

Open UniFlash and detect board

Choose CC2650F128 device and Texas Instruments XDS110 USB Debug Probe

Need to select All Files to see <c file name>.cc26x0-cc13x0 (default Custom Files)

Load Image and check success message

Install Realterm and follow settings (every time) to see output

Display: Choose Ansi (default All Chars of Ascii), check newLine mode, change Rows to 40
Port: baudrate = 115200 and choose same UART port in Device Manager (COM6 for now)
Press Change and select Open

Press reset button on SensorTag and verify output
