Q1 Birthday Problem

a) 17 students in tutorial, probability 2 students have same birthday

1 - P(all different birthday)
1 - 365*364*...(365-17+1)/365^17 = ~0.315

b) 141 students, probability no same birthday

365*364*...(365-141+1)/365^141 = ~2.3x10^-14 v small

Q2 whitespace freq in unused part of TV spectrum

better propogation due to lower freq
less inteference from other wireless devices
improve capacity, alleviate congestion


Q3 time slotted neighbour discovery

a) time slot 200ms, wake up with probability of 0.1, average time for 2 nodes to select a common slot to wake

P(wake up same time slot) = 0.1 x 0.1 = 0.01
Expected time slots = 1/P(wake up same slot) = 100
average time = 100x200ms = 20s

b) beacon transmission to announce node presence transmitted at beginning and end of active time slot.
Should transmission be performed more often to increase chance of discovery

may improve discovery when num nodes small

freq collisions when num nodes large

Q4 air quality sensors

lifetime => battery => 5-10 years

data rate => few bytes per reading, infrequent => <10kbps 

wireless network => transmit distant gateway => range 2-5km => LP-WAN

LoRa 15km range, low power consumption, 100kbps


b) 2-FSK vs LoRa

LoRa high range and robust, unlicensed band, existing infrastructure easily reused

2-FSK straightforward, widespread among radio chipset, higher throughput

3MHz

2-FSK => 3MHz/125kHz = 24 sensors

LoRa => orthoganal spreading factors,
